  <h3>Title of Study:</h3>
  <p class="text-info">Laterality and Dimorphism in Facial Trustworthiness Judgments</p>

  <h3>Researcher:</h3>
  <p>Christopher M. Vetrano, Fielding Graduate University</p>

  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>
    You are being invited to take part in a research study about how people evaluate facial traits.
    The goal is to understand how features like facial structure and symmetry influence judgments of trustworthiness.
    <strong>What You’ll Do:</strong> You’ll view a series of facial images and rate each for trustworthiness.
    You’ll also compare sides of the face to indicate which appears more masculine or feminine.
    You will then complete two short surveys on trust and personality.
  </p>

  <h3>Time Commitment:</h3>
  <p>About 15–20 minutes</p>

  <h3>Risks:</h3>
  <p>
    Minimal. There are no sensitive questions or identifying information collected.
    All images are neutral and pre-approved for research.
  </p>

  <h3>Benefits:</h3>
  <p>No direct benefits, but your responses will contribute to research on how people form impressions from faces.</p>

  <h3>Voluntary Participation:</h3>
  <p>Your participation is voluntary. You may stop at any time without penalty.</p>

  <h3>Anonymity:</h3>
  <p>Your responses are anonymous. No identifying information will be collected or stored.</p>

  <h3>Compensation:</h3>
  <p>You will be paid through Prolific in line with their fair pay policies.</p>

  <h3>Sample Question:</h3>
  <p>On a scale from 1 to 7, how trustworthy does this face appear?</p>
